    <p>
      Pizza (/ÀàpiÀêts…ô/ PEET-s…ô, Italian: [Ààpittsa]; Neapolitan: [Ààpitts…ô]) is a
      traditional Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened
      wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked
      at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] The term
      pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from
      the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with
      Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating modern pizza
      in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the
      European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017,
      the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of
      intangible cultural heritage.[7]
